* Overview

`xzenfmt` is a minimalist command-line tool designed to format source code using external formatters and strip comments/whitespace across various programming languages. It now features enhanced comment stripping that can remove lines consisting only of comments.

It aims to provide a single, fast, consistent, and "zen-like" (minimal output) interface for maintaining clean and uniformly formatted codebases.

* Why It Exists

I want xzenfmt to handle comments across various languages efficiently,

and make the code readable like zen without distractions.

The research about FSM argumented and data sturcuture for storing comments can be found on

[[file:VISION.org][VISION.org]]

* What Problem Does it Solves ?

Only of the main reasons of this tool creation was to solve the common problem of AI assistants adding excessive comments to generated code.

I'm not against comments, but less the comments the much better.

* Getting Started
1. Ensure Rust and required external formatters (see [[file:.org/SETUP.org][SETUP.org]]) are installed.
2. Run `rake setup` in the project root.
3. Check dependencies: `cargo run --bin xzenfmt -- --check-dependencies`
4. **Default (Format Only):** `cargo run --bin xzenfmt -- path/to/your/code`
5. **Strip Comments (Smart):** `cargo run --bin xzenfmt -- --strip-comments path/to/your/code`
6. **Format -> Strip -> Format:** `cargo run --bin xzenfmt -- --all path/to/your/code`
7. **Other Modes:** Use `--strip-whitespace` or `--strip-newlines`.

(See [[file:.org/CLI.org][CLI.org]] for all options - requires creating this file).
